# GamecontrolEmu
Python script to emulate touch input using automated mouse clicks for Ipad games that run on M1 Mac.
Makes use of pynput library.
Use 'pip install pynput' to install library into your environment.
Created specifically for the game 'Genshin Impact'.
When ipad games are installed on M1 mac, they dont usually support keyboard input for controls.
They do allow clicking on the screen with your mouse(anagolous to touch input on ipad screens).
This script takes keyboard input and converts them to mouse clicks on screen.
Modifiable as a work around for keyboard support on other M1 Mac-compatible ipad/iphone games.
